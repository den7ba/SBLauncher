## About

This is a tiny supervisor for sandboxed processes used for my specific tasks. The sandboxes are provided by the [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/) app. The goal of the project is to run applications in a sandbox and restart them if they crash.

## Building
Tested with MS Visual Studio 2019 and later. SDK v.22621. x64.
